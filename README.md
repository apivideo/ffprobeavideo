# FFPROBE

FFprobe is an open source tool that is a part of FFMPEG.  It provides you with basic details about the video - how it was encoded, the bitrate, etc.

This application runs ffprobe on a NodeJS server. Enter the URL of a video in the form, and receive the results from FFPROBE.

Pretty simple application that makes a handy tool easy to use on the internet, courtesy of api.video
